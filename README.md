**Problem statement:**

Halloween begins a candy consumption frenzy in the USA that continues into the Christmas holidays and New Year’s Day. After New Year's Day, candy consumption dies down slightly, which may be attributed to New Year's resolutions to cut out sugary snacks (and of course those resolutions often do not last long). But all this consumption first needs production and the aim of this project is to forecast candy production for 2010. There are several reasons why a candy company might need to forecast their production:
- Planning and inventory management: By forecasting their production, a candy company can estimate the amount of candy they need to produce to meet anticipated demand. 
- Seasonal demand: Candy companies often experience seasonal fluctuations in demand, such as during holidays like Halloween, Christmas, or Easter. By forecasting production, they can adjust their manufacturing capacity, raw material procurement, and staffing levels to meet the increased demand during peak seasons and avoid underproduction or overproduction.
- Supply chain optimization: Accurate production forecasting allows candy companies to coordinate their supply chain activities more effectively.
- Cost control: Production forecasting helps candy companies optimize their production processes, reduce waste, and minimize production costs.
- New product launches: When introducing new candy products or flavors, forecasting production can help estimate the initial demand and production requirements. This allows the company to allocate resources appropriately and prevent either shortages or excess inventory of the new products.
- Business planning and decision-making: Production forecasts provide valuable information for strategic business planning and decision-making. They help candy companies set realistic production targets, evaluate the financial feasibility of production plans, assess potential risks and opportunities, and align their overall business strategy accordingly.
